# How to add your Links
We have restructured our database in a completely new format which is more clearer and easy to understand.

#### Follow these instructions:

<ul>
<li>
A newly created category and subcategory should be added to the data file
</li>
<li>A category has it's own folder</li>
<li>
A subcategory is contained in a category folder
</li>

<li>
When a new category is added ensure to create a folder for it
</li>
<li>
When a new subcategory is added ensure to create a json file for it and place in its respective category
</li>
<li>
Add your resources to the subcategory json file of your choice
</li>
<li>
Export the newly created json file on the index file
</li>
</ul>
